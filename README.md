To set up this program on your local machine, start by cloning the project's git repository. This can be done by using the 'git clone' command followed by the URL of the repository. Once you have the repository on your local machine, you can view the files in your preferred code editor. The project requires several libraries to run correctly, including Pandas, Scipy Stats,  Numpy, and Plotly Express. Make sure these libraries are installed on your local Python environment. If not, you can install them using pip, a package installer for Python.
